// Name: Gerard Lawrence
 // Program: C++
 // Summary: Write a Theater Seating program that can be used by a small theater to sell tickets for performances. The theaterâ€™s auditorium has 15 rows of seats, with 30 seats in each row (Two-dimensional array). The program should display a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. For example, the following screen shows a char depicting each seat in the theater. Seats that are taken are represented by an * symbol, and seats that are available are represented by a # symbol.
 // Due Date: 12/14/2018
 // 12/07/2018 Rev A. Wrote code to display menu and user input
 // 12/08/2018 Rev B. Wrote code for switch for menu and seat display
 // 12/09/2018 Rev C. Wrote code to display seat prices and updating prices
 // 12/12/2018 Rev D. Worked on output structure; making the sentences look neat and adding proper spacing.
 // 12/12/2018 Rev E. Wrote code for output file but Struggled for days with code for input of prices.
 // 12/13/2018 Rev F. Unable to find a way to show input of new seat prices without running into some kind of error.
 // 12/14/2018 Rev F. Finalized code; wrote comments.
